### **Objects** (20 objects supported)
- `bird` → Detailed bird with beak, wings, tail
- `airplane` → Aircraft with body, wings, tail
- `car` → Vehicle with wheels and windows
- `tree` → Tree with trunk and leaves
- `house` → House with roof, door, windows
- `flower` → Flower with stem, petals, center
- `cat` → Cat with ears, eyes, nose
- `dog` → Dog with floppy ears
- `fish` → Fish with body, tail, fins

- `moon` → Crescent moon shape
- `cloud` → Puffy cloud formation
- `ball` → Ball with highlight
- `book` → Book with cover and pages
- `cup` → Cup with handle and steam

## 🎯 **Example Prompts & Results**

### **"create a red bird"**
- **PNG**: Red bird with gradient background, detailed features, texture
- **Vector**: Clean geometric red bird on white background

### **"blue airplane"**
- **PNG**: Blue airplane with realistic details, gradient sky
- **Vector**: Simple geometric blue airplane

### **"green tree"**
- **PNG**: Green tree with brown trunk, textured background
- **Vector**: Clean geometric tree shape

### **"yellow flower"**
- **PNG**: Yellow flower with stem, detailed petals, golden center
- **Vector**: Simple geometric flower

### **"purple cat"**
- **PNG**: Purple cat with ears, eyes, pink nose
- **Vector**: Geometric purple cat

### **"black car"**
- **PNG**: Black car with wheels, windows, detailed features
- **Vector**: Simple black car shape

## 🎨 **Style Differences**

### **PNG Generation** (Detailed Style)
- Gradient backgrounds
- Texture and noise effects
- Detailed object features
- Realistic proportions
- Rich color variations

### **Vector Generation** (Clean Style)
- White background
- Geometric shapes
- Clean lines
- Simple forms
- Professional look

## 🧠 **How It Works**

1. **Prompt Analysis**: System parses your text for colors and objects
2. **Color Extraction**: Finds the first color mentioned in your prompt
3. **Object Recognition**: 
   - **Predefined Objects**: If found, draws specific detailed shapes
   - **Dynamic Generation**: If not found, creates unique patterns based on prompt complexity
4. **Style Selection**: PNG = detailed, Vector = geometric
5. **Canvas Generation**: Creates 512x512 image with your specifications
6. **History Update**: Adds to your generation history

## 🎨 **Dynamic Generation**

**ANY prompt now works!** If your prompt doesn't contain a predefined object, the system creates:

- **PNG Style**: Dynamic shapes, gradients, textures, connecting lines
- **Vector Style**: Clean geometric patterns, shapes, and lines
- **Complexity**: More words = more shapes and elements
- **Uniqueness**: Each generation is different even with the same prompt

## 🎮 **Try These Prompts**

```
✅ "red bird"
✅ "blue airplane" 
✅ "green tree"
✅ "yellow flower"
✅ "purple cat"
✅ "black car"
✅ "pink butterfly"
✅ "brown dog"
✅ "white house"
✅ "orange fish"
✅ "black hat" ← NEW!
✅ "green mountain" ← NEW!
✅ "yellow star" ← NEW!
✅ "red heart" ← NEW!
✅ "orange sun" ← NEW!
✅ "white moon" ← NEW!
✅ "blue cloud" ← NEW!
✅ "purple ball" ← NEW!
✅ "brown book" ← NEW!
✅ "pink cup" ← NEW!
```

## 🔄 **Combination Examples**

### **Predefined Objects** (20 specific objects)
- **"create a red bird"** → Red bird
- **"blue airplane flying"** → Blue airplane  
- **"beautiful green tree"** → Green tree
- **"small yellow flower"** → Yellow flower
- **"cute purple cat"** → Purple cat

### **Dynamic Generation** (ANY other prompt)
- **"mountain with snow outside"** → Dynamic mountain-like pattern
- **"abstract art"** → Unique abstract composition
- **"futuristic city"** → Dynamic futuristic shapes
- **"magical forest"** → Dynamic nature-inspired pattern
- **"space exploration"** → Dynamic space-themed composition
- **"coffee shop"** → Dynamic cafe-inspired pattern
- **"dancing robot"** → Dynamic robot-like shapes
- **"ocean waves"** → Dynamic wave-like patterns

## 🎯 **Advanced Features**

### **Fallback Behavior**
- If no color specified → Default blue (#4ecdc4)
- If no predefined object found → **Dynamic generation** with unique patterns
- If multiple colors → Uses first one found
- If multiple objects → Uses first one found
- **Dynamic complexity** → More words = more shapes and elements

### **Text Display**
- Your original prompt appears at the top of generated images
- PNG: Bold 24px text
- Vector: Bold 20px text

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

While you download your sample data, this system gives you:

1. **Immediate Results**: Generate images right now
2. **Realistic Workflow**: Test the UI and user experience  
3. **Prompt Testing**: See how different prompts work
4. **Style Comparison**: PNG vs Vector differences
5. **History Management**: Build up a collection of generated images

## 🎨 **Pro Tips**

- **Be Specific**: "red bird" works better than just "bird"
- **Try Combinations**: "blue airplane" or "green tree"
- **Compare Styles**: Generate same prompt as both PNG and Vector
- **Build History**: Generate multiple images to see the scrollbar
- **Test Colors**: Try all 10 supported colors
- **Test Objects**: Try all 10 supported objects
